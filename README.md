# Shell-Projects-Practice
This repository contains various shell scripting projects for practice and learning. Each project is designed to help you improve your skills in shell scripting, covering tasks such as automation, data manipulation, and system management.


## [1] - Weather reporting tasks

Extract and store the following data every day at noon, local time, for Casablanca, Morocco:

- The actual temperature (in degrees Celsius)
- The forecasted temperature (in degrees Celsius) for the following day at noon

[Weather](scripts\forecast.sh)

## [2] - Backs up any encrypted password files

Imagine that you are a lead Linux developer at the top-tech company ABC International Inc. ABC currently suffers from a huge bottleneck: each day, interns must painstakingly access encrypted password files on core servers and back up any files that were updated within the last 24 hours. This process introduces human error, lowers security, and takes an unreasonable amount of work.

As one of ABC Inc.'s most trusted Linux developers, you have been tasked with creating a script called backup.sh which runs every day and automatically backs up any encrypted password files that have been updated in the past 24 hours.
